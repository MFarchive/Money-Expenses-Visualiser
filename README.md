# Money-Expenses-Visualiser
A tool to visualise your net worth, bank balances, total expenses, etc.


1) Edit the demo file with a list of your own payments in and out of all your accounts. Do not change the column names, this would require modifying the rest of the code.

2) .r file contains all the code to produce all the visuals. This is done mostly with reactables and plot_ly.

The aim of this tool is to help track your expenses, see what most of your money is being spent towards, and help visualise your net worth.
I would recommend updating the demo file .csv spreadsheet with your expenses from your monthly bank account statements.
